Powershell Support Form for SyncroMSP
Made with instsructional assistance from Dan Stolts "ITProGuru" https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/GuruPowerShell/GUI-Form-Using-PowerShell-Add-Panel-Label-Edit-box-Combo-Box-List-Box-CheckBox-and-More

Currently, this only works if you save this script to the local machine as .ps1 (ex. C:\itfolder\support_form.ps1), make a .bat file with the same name, in the same folder (ex. C:\itfolder\support_form.bat), with this in the .bat file [@echo off powershell.exe -Command "& '%~dpn0.ps1'"] (Keep the quotes,don't use the brackets)
